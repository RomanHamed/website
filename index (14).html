                <h2>Click Alonzo</h2>
                <p>Click Alonzo was the very first snap project we were assigned in AP Computer Science. It’s a game in which you essentially just have to click on the “sprite” until it fades away. This project is important to me because it helped me understand the basics of the snap program.</p>

                <h2>PC build</h2>
                <p>My pc is one of the best things I have ever invested in. I learned so much about computers in general and it made so many more things easier. It helped me pursue my love for computers further and was fun to build all the way through.</p>

                <h2>Python CMU</h2>
                <p>For Genius Hour, I chose to do Python CMU. I wanted to learn the basics of Python to further my programming skills and also because I generally enjoy doing it. So far, I have learned basic skills such as making shapes, adding colors, and adding gradients.</p>

                <h2>Drawing App:Clothing Simulator </h2>
                <p> This app was created by me and my Partner Matthew Lee for the Congressional App Challenge. The website's purpose is to help people find and plan outfit they would like to wear. Creating this game was overall a very fun experience and we learned a lot---snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=inho24&ProjectName=clothing%20project </p>

                <h2>Frank Ocean Music Player</h2>
                <p> This is another app created by me and my partner Matthew Lee. We made this project to give people a taste of one of favorite artist, Frank Ocean. The app itself plays and shuffles a few of our favorite Frank Ocean Songs.  </p>
