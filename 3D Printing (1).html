                <h2>Flat Object</h2>
                <p>Our first 3D print task was to print a flat object using the Cura software and printing on the Ultimaker 3 Extended.Since it is flat print, there was no need to print support. I exported one of my "Heart Ring" TinkerCAD projects into a .STL and printed that</p>

                <h2>Break-Off Support</h2>
                <p>Our second 3D printing task was to print something more sophisticated than a flat print. This would require the use of support. In this instance we used "break off" support that  can be taken off of our modeled print with plyers or other tools. Again, I used my "mario" TinkerCAD project and exported it as a .STL and used Cura. However, this time I printed on the Ultimaker 2+.</p>

                <h2>Soluble Support</h2>
                <p> Our 3rd 3D printing task was to print something again with support, but this time the support will be soluble meaning it would dissolve in a liquid. This time instead of using Cura and  the  Ultimakers, I used the AutoCAD software and printed on Stratasys. However, I still exported a TinkerCAD project as a .STL into the software again. The white stuff printed around my Shadow will dissolve once I put it into Sodium Hydroxide.  </p>
